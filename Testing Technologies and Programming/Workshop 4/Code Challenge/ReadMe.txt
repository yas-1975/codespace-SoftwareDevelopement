Secret Number
Instructions
Secret number - a short game to guess a secret number. 

In a language of your choice, write a solution for the game that satisfies the following criteria:

Generates a random number.

Takes in a guess.

Returns a string with the guess and whether that guess is lower or higher than the random number. 
E.g., “You answered 9. The correct answer is higher.”

If the guess matches the random number, then return a string which confirms this. E.g., “You answered 9. This is the correct answer!”


This challenge (deliberately) does not give any guidance about ranges, input validation, presentation etc., 
so you are also required to explain any assumptions that you have made. This can be done using comments in the code or in a readme file, or both.
