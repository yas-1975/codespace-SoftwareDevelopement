Activity - Research

In this activity you are required to research about the topics:

1. What is Software Testing?

This is a method to which to asses the funcitonality of a software programs.  The process will check whether the software
matches the requirements and to ensure that the software is bug-free.  It's purpose is to identify any errors, faults or 
any missing requirements.

2. Types Of Software Testing:

* Functional Testing:

What is Functional Testing?

This is a thype of software testing which validate the software system against its function requirements and the specifications.  This ensures
that it functions as it is expected to and meets the funcitonality.

Give 3 examples.

1. Unit Testing - This Focuses on individual units or components.
2. Smoke Testing -  A preliminary test to ensure that critical functionalities work after software has been built
3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) This Validates whether the software meets user expectations.

Non-Functional Testing:

What is Non-Functional Testing?

This type of testing is to verifty non functional aspects of the products, e.g. the performance, stabiltiy and usability of the software.  
This is to test how well the product performs.
 
Give 3 examples.

1. Performance Test
2. Stress Test
3.  Security Tests
