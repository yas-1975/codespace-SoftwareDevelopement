# Shopping-List-Project-Team-4

Hi Team 4!

In this task you and your team are required to build a shopping list app.

Is not essential that you use any framework to fulfil the task but, this could be a good exercise to practice your bootstrap skills, if you wish to.

You'll work as a team and each team member should work on a different functionality of the app.

Write a step-by-step testing strategy that will help you keep track on what to test.

Test all the elements of the app (buttons, input fields, text fields, etc).
