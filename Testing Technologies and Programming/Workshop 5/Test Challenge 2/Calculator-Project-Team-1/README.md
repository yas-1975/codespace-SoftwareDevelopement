Is not essential that you use any framework to fulfil the task but, this could be a good exercise to practice your bootstrap skills, if you wish to.  
<br/>
You'll work as a team and each team member should work on a different operation (as a suggestion).
<br/><br/>
Ex: adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, etc.
